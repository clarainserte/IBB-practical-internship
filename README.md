# FUNCTIONAL CARACTERIZATION OF GENETIC VARIANTS FROM REGIONS SUBJECTED TO NATURAL SELECTION

This repository contains the R code (documented in jupyter notebooks) elaborated by Clara Inserte during the practical internships on the IBB institute functionally characterizing the genetic variants from The 1000 Genomes Project to find coordinate overlaps between genetic variants segregating in the population/s showing the selection signature/s for each candidate selection region and putative functional regions in the genome.

The code contained in "FUNCTIONAL_CHARACTERIZATION_TABLE.ipynb" corresponds to the filtering and merging of all the data from the main functional databases (VEP, GWAS Catalog, RegulomeDB, ClinVar, DisGeNEt and Atlas of Variant Age) used to functionally characterize the genetic variants. 

The code contained in "SHINY-APP.ipynb" corresponds to the creation of an interactive tool that allows filtering and sorting the genetic variants by functional annotations and different attributes such as population/s showing selection signature/s.
